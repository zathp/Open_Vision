Savable project files with multiple files and filters saved in them

The ability to stack image filters visually to combine filters together, and see what filters have been aplied in what order in the project file.

node based visual chaining of filters and image merges

(side) build for exporting to blender texture maps

Current architecture update (implemented):
- Main app file is now focused on a project menu for selecting and creating working projects.
- Image editing functions are moved out to separate modules.
- A dedicated editor window is launched from the selected project.
- Project files use the .ovproj format in a Projects directory.

Project types:
1) Node Graph Project (.ovproj) - Advanced node-based workflow
   - Node-based visual chaining of filters and image merges
   - Filter stack visualization and management
   - Designed for complex compositing and Blender texture export

2) Paint Project (.ovpaint) - MS Paint-style editing
   - Direct image editing with tool palette interface
   - Access to Initial_Forms tools: Downsampler, Mirror, Region Selector, Greenscreen/Color Replace
   - Simpler, tool-based workflow for quick edits and transformations
   - Single-image focused with layer support

Expanded MVP direction (clarified):

NODE GRAPH PROJECT TYPE:

1) Project file scope (.ovproj)
- Save loaded image paths.
- Save filter stack per image.
- Save global filter graph data.
- Save output presets.
- Goal: reopening a project restores practical working context.

2) Filter stack MVP behavior
- Use a linear ordered list of filters only (no branching in first version).
- Filters apply top-to-bottom.
- Keep room for future enable/disable and masking without breaking format.

3) Node graph MVP scope
- Required first nodes:
	- Image Input node
	- Color Replace node
	- Output node
- Goal: prove end-to-end graph execution with minimum complexity.

4) Blender export MVP scope
- Generate Base Color (Albedo) output first.
- Defer Normal, Roughness, Metallic, Height, and ORM packing until after Albedo pipeline is stable.

PAINT PROJECT TYPE:

1) Project file scope (.ovpaint)
- Save current image and canvas state
- Save active layer stack
- Save tool settings and last-used parameters
- Goal: quick resumption of editing session

2) Tool palette MVP
- Integration with Initial_Forms utilities:
  - Downsampler: HSV-aware image downsampling/pixelation tool
  - Mirror: Flip image horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
  - Region Selector: Interactive crop with out-of-bounds transparency support
  - Color Replace/Greenscreen: Select and replace colors with range tolerance
- Additional paint tools:
  - Brush/Pencil for direct pixel editing
  - Fill bucket for color areas
  - Eyedropper for color selection
  - Selection tools (rectangle, lasso)

3) Layer system MVP
- Basic layer stack (create, delete, reorder, rename)
- Layer visibility toggle
- Flatten/merge layers
- Export individual layers or flattened result

4) Canvas behavior
- Zoom and pan controls
- Undo/redo stack for editing operations
- Grid and guides (optional)
- Direct canvas painting and tool application

Proposed next additions to define soon:
- Project versioning field for .ovproj/.ovpaint format upgrades.
- Missing-file handling strategy for moved/deleted source images.
- Filter parameter schema (shared format for list mode and node mode).
- Export naming templates and conflict policy (overwrite, suffix, or prompt).
- Project type selector in main menu (Node Graph vs Paint)
- Tool parameter persistence across sessions
- Brush size, opacity, and blend mode settings
- Custom color palette save/load
- Keyboard shortcuts for tool switching
