Savable project files with multiple files and filters saved in them

The ability to stack image filters visually to combine filters together, and see what filters have been aplied in what order in the project file.

node based visual chaining of filters and image merges

(side) build for exporting to blender texture maps

Current architecture update (implemented):
- Main app file is now focused on a project menu for selecting and creating working projects.
- Image editing functions are moved out to separate modules.
- A dedicated editor window is launched from the selected project.
- Project files use the .ovproj format in a Projects directory.

Expanded MVP direction (clarified):

1) Project file scope (.ovproj)
- Save loaded image paths.
- Save filter stack per image.
- Save global filter graph data.
- Save output presets.
- Goal: reopening a project restores practical working context.

2) Filter stack MVP behavior
- Use a linear ordered list of filters only (no branching in first version).
- Filters apply top-to-bottom.
- Keep room for future enable/disable and masking without breaking format.

3) Node graph MVP scope
- Required first nodes:
	- Image Input node
	- Color Replace node
	- Output node
- Goal: prove end-to-end graph execution with minimum complexity.

4) Blender export MVP scope
- Generate Base Color (Albedo) output first.
- Defer Normal, Roughness, Metallic, Height, and ORM packing until after Albedo pipeline is stable.

Proposed next additions to define soon:
- Project versioning field for .ovproj format upgrades.
- Missing-file handling strategy for moved/deleted source images.
- Filter parameter schema (shared format for list mode and node mode).
- Export naming templates and conflict policy (overwrite, suffix, or prompt).
