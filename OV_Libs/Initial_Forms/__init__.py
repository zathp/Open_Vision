Initial_Forms - Legacy standalone image processing tools

This package contains the original standalone tools that will be
integrated into the Paint Editor interface:

- Downsampler: HSV-based color reduction and downsampling
- Mirror: Image flipping and mirroring operations
- RegionSelector: Interactive region selection and cropping
- Greenscreen2: Color replacement and greenscreen removal
- Greenscreen2_Batch: Batch color replacement operations

These tools currently run as standalone scripts but are being
refactored for integration into the main application.
